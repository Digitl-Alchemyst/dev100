# Day 7 Challenge: "Type Coercion Predictor"

## Problem Statement
Create a function that takes two values and an operator as input, and returns the result of the operation along with an explanation of any type coercion that occurred.

In JavaScript, type coercion is the process of converting one data type to another, often automatically and implicitly. This behavior can lead to unexpected results if not carefully handled.
## Function Signature

This function will take 3 inputs, which we'll call `val1`, `val2`, and `operator`, and it will return an object containing the result of the operation and an explanation of any type coercion.

```javascript
function coercionPredictor(val1, val2, operator) {
  // Your code here
}
```
### Input
- **val1** and **val2**: Any two values (e.g., number, string, boolean, object, etc.)
- **operator**: A string representing the operation to perform. The possible operators are:
  - `'+'` (addition or concatenation)
  - `'-'` (subtraction)
  - `'*'` (multiplication)
  - `'/'` (division)
  - `'=='` (loose equality comparison)
  - `'==='` (strict equality comparison)

### Output
An object containing the following properties:

- **result**: The result of the operation.
- **explanation**: A string that explains any type coercion that occurred during the operation.

## Examples

- **Input:** `{ val1: "5", val2: 2, operator: "*" }`
- **Output:** `{ result: 10, explanation: "String '5' was coerced to number 5 for multiplication." }`

- **Input:** `{ val1: 1, val2: "1", operator: "==" }`
- **Output:** `{ result: true, explanation: "Loose equality comparison may involve coercion: number and string were compared." }`

- **Input:** `{ val1: true, val2: "false", operator: "+" }`
- **Output:** `{ result: "truefalse", explanation: "Boolean true was coerced to a string for concatenation." }`

- **Input:** `{ val1: null, val2: 5, operator: "==" }`
- **Output:** `{ result: false, explanation: "Loose equality comparison: null was not coerced to a number." }`

- **Input:** `{ val1: undefined, val2: 0, operator: "*" }`
- **Output:** `{ result: NaN, explanation: "Undefined was coerced to NaN for multiplication." }`

## Test the Function

```javascript
console.log(coercionPredictor("5", 2, "*")); // Output: { result: 10, explanation: "Both values were coerced to numbers for multiplication." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(1, "1", "==")); // Output: { result: true, explanation: "Loose equality comparison may involve coercion: number and string were compared." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(1, 1, "===")); // Output: { result: true, explanation: "Strict equality comparison: no type coercion occurred." }
```

## Expanded Instructions

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

To solve this problem, you need to be familiar with JavaScript's type coercion mechanisms. Type coercion can happen when different types are involved in an operation, such as a string being added to a number or compared to a boolean. Understanding how JavaScript handles these conversions is key to correctly implementing this function.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Type Conversion:** JavaScript automatically converts types during operations like addition or comparison.
- **Loose vs. Strict Equality:** `==` allows type coercion, while `===` does not, which can lead to different results.
- **String and Number Operations:** When using `+`, if one operand is a string, JavaScript converts the other operand to a string. For `-`, `*`, and `/`, JavaScript converts operands to numbers.

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**

- How does JavaScript handle operations between a number and a string?
- What happens when a boolean is involved in an arithmetic operation?
- How do loose and strict equality checks differ when comparing different types?

### Step 2: Potential Solutions

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the given values with the specified operator and identify any type coercion that occurs. Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. **Type Checking:**
   - Check the types of `val1` and `val2` before applying the operation.
   - Depending on their types and the operator, JavaScript might automatically coerce one or both values into a different type (e.g., converting a string to a number).

2. **Operator Handling:**
   - Handle each operator ('+', '-', '*', '/', '==', '===') individually, since different operators can cause different kinds of type coercion.
   - Provide an explanation based on the operator's behavior and the types of `val1` and `val2`.

3. **Generating the Explanation:**
   - After performing the operation, generate a human-readable explanation of any type coercion that occurred.
   - This explanation should detail how JavaScript handled the operation, including any implicit conversions.

## Step 3: Implementing the Function

We'll break the implementation into handling each operator individually.

### Algorithm:
1. Check the types of `val1` and `val2`.
2. Store the initial types of `val1` and `val2`.
3. Perform the operation based on the operator.
   - Depending on the operator, apply the appropriate operation.
4. Track if any type coercion occurs during the operation.
5. Generate an explanation.
   - If type coercion occurred, describe how and why it happened.
   - If no coercion occurred, explain that the operation was performed without any type conversion.
6. Return the result and explanation.

### Implementation:

```javascript
function coercionPredictor(val1, val2, operator) {
  let result;
  let explanation = '';
  const initialType1 = typeof val1;
  const initialType2 = typeof val2;

  switch (operator) {
    case '+':
      result = val1 + val2;
      if (initialType1 === 'string' || initialType2 === 'string') {
        explanation = `One or both values were coerced to strings for concatenation.`;
      } else {
        explanation = `No coercion occurred. Both values were added as numbers.`;
      }
      break;

    case '-':
      result = val1 - val2;
      explanation = `Both values were coerced to numbers for subtraction.`;
      break;

    case '*':
      result = val1 * val2;
      explanation = `Both values were coerced to numbers for multiplication.`;
      break;

    case
```

### Explanation:

**Addition (+) Operator:**

- If either `val1` or `val2` is a string, JavaScript will coerce the other value to a string as well, resulting in concatenation.
- If both are numbers, they are added numerically.

**Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/) Operators:**

- These operators require numeric values, so JavaScript will attempt to coerce both `val1` and `val2` to numbers.

**Loose Equality (==) Operator:**

- This operator allows type coercion, meaning JavaScript may convert one or both values to the same type before comparing them.

**Strict Equality (===) Operator:**

- This operator checks both the value and the type, so no type coercion occurs.

### Example Usage:

```javascript
console.log(coercionPredictor("5", 2, "*")); // Output: { result: 10, explanation: "Both values were coerced to numbers for multiplication." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(1, "1", "==")); // Output: { result: true, explanation: "Loose equality comparison may involve coercion: number and string were compared." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(1, 1, "===")); // Output: { result: true, explanation: "Strict equality comparison: no type coercion occurred." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(true, "1", "+")); // Output: { result: "true1", explanation: "Boolean true was coerced to a string for concatenation." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(null, 5, "==")); // Output: { result: false, explanation: "Loose equality comparison: null was not coerced to a number." }

console.log(coercionPredictor(undefined, 0, "*")); // Output: { result: NaN, explanation: "Undefined was coerced to NaN for multiplication." }

```
