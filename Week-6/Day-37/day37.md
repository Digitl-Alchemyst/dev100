Each arithmetic method should use the 'this' keyword to access and update a 'result' property of the object.

## Reflections and Notes

Todays challenge was really hard. I had to use AI to walk me through it step by step. I understand a little bit but not enough to solve it on my own. I will have to go back to this concept and try again.
