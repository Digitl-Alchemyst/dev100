# Advanced JavaScript Objects: Methods, 'this', and State

## Introduction (3 minutes)

Welcome, everyone! Today, we're diving deeper into the world of JavaScript objects. We'll explore three crucial concepts that are fundamental to object-oriented programming in JavaScript:

1. Object methods
2. The 'this' keyword
3. Maintaining state within objects

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of these concepts and how they work together to create powerful, flexible, and efficient code.

Let's get started!

## 1. Object Methods (10 minutes)

### 1.1 What are Object Methods?

Object methods are functions that are associated with an object. They allow objects to have behavior in addition to storing data.

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
```

### Description Script:
Imagine our object is like a robot. The properties (like name and age) are the robot's characteristics, but methods are like giving the robot abilities or actions it can perform.

In this example, we've given our 'person' object the ability to greet. The `greet` property is a function, which makes it a method of the `person` object.

When we call `person.greet()`, it's like pressing a button on our robot to make it perform its greeting action.

### 1.2 Shorthand Method Syntax

ES6 introduced a shorter way to define methods:

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    greet() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};
```

### Description Script:
This is just a more concise way of writing the same thing. It's like a shortcut in robot programming. Instead of saying "here's a property called 'greet' that is a function", we can just say "here's a thing the robot can do called 'greet'".

The result is exactly the same, but it's quicker to write and often easier to read.

## 2. The 'this' Keyword (15 minutes)

### 2.1 Understanding 'this'

The 'this' keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function.

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Bob",
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};

person.sayName(); // Output: Bob
```

### Description Script:
The 'this' keyword is like a self-aware robot. When a robot performs an action, it needs to know about itself to do the action correctly.

In our example, when the `sayName` method runs, 'this' refers to the `person` object. It's like the robot saying, "Hey, I need to say my name. What's my name again? Oh right, it's Bob."

This self-awareness allows methods to access and use the object's other properties.

### 2.2 'this' in Different Contexts

The value of 'this' can change depending on how a function is called:

```javascript
let name = "Global Name";

let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};

person.sayName(); // Output: Alice

let globalSayName = person.sayName;
globalSayName(); // Output: Global Name (in non-strict mode)
```

### Description Script:
The 'this' keyword can be tricky because it changes based on context. It's like our robot being moved to different rooms in a house.

When we call `person.sayName()`, the robot (our function) is in the "person room", so 'this' refers to the person object.

But when we assign the method to a global variable and call it (`globalSayName()`), it's like we've moved our robot to the "global room". Now, 'this' refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode), which has a different 'name' property.

This flexibility of 'this' is powerful but can also lead to bugs if we're not careful about where and how we call our functions.

## 2.2.1 Further Explanation:
The key thing to remember is that in JavaScript, this is determined by how a function is called, not where it's defined. Let's explore this with a few more scenarios:

Object Method:
When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to that object.

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Bob",
    greet() {
        console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
    }
};
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, I'm Bob
```

Here, this inside `greet()` refers to person because we called the function as person.greet().

### Global Context:
When a function is called in the global scope, this refers to the global object (in browsers, this is usually window).

```javascript
function sayHi() {
    console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
}
let name = "Global";
sayHi(); // Output: Hi, I'm Global
```

### Function Borrowing:
We can use methods like `call()` or `apply()` to explicitly set what this should be:

```javascript
let person1 = { name: "Alice" };
let person2 = { name: "Bob" };

function introduce() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
}

introduce.call(person1); // Output: My name is Alice
introduce.call(person2); // Output: My name is Bob
```

### Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions don't have their own this. They inherit this from the enclosing scope:

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Charlie",
    regularFunction: function() {
        console.log("Regular function:", this.name);
    },
    arrowFunction: () => {
        console.log("Arrow function:", this.name);
    }
};

person.regularFunction(); // Output: Regular function: Charlie
person.arrowFunction();   // Output: Arrow function: undefined (or whatever `this` is in the outer scope)
```

### Callback Functions:
When you pass a method as a callback, it can lose its this binding:

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "David",
    greet() {
        console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, I'm David
// Passing the method as a callback
setTimeout(person.greet, 1000); // Output after 1 second: Hello, I'm undefined
```
To fix this, you can either use `bind()` or an arrow function:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => person.greet(), 1000); // This will work as expected
```

The key takeaway is that this is dynamic and can change based on how a function is invoked. It's not determined by where the function is defined, but by how it's called. This flexibility allows for powerful patterns in JavaScript, but it can also be a source of confusion if you're not careful.

### 2.3 Binding 'this'

We can explicitly set what 'this' should refer to using methods like `bind()`, `call()`, or `apply()`:

```javascript
let person1 = { name: "Alice" };
let person2 = { name: "Bob" };

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
}

let aliceGreet = sayHello.bind(person1);
aliceGreet(); // Output: Hello, Alice

sayHello.call(person2); // Output: Hello, Bob
```

### Description Script:
Sometimes, we want to control exactly what 'this' refers to, regardless of how the function is called. It's like giving our robot specific instructions about which room it's in, no matter where we actually put it.

`bind()` creates a new function with 'this' set to a specific value. It's like creating a new robot that always thinks it's in Alice's room.

`call()` and `apply()` (not shown) immediately call the function with 'this' set to a specific value. It's like temporarily teleporting our robot to Bob's room for one action.

These methods give us fine-grained control over what 'this' means in our functions.

## 3. Maintaining State within Objects (12 minutes)

Objects can maintain their own internal state, which can be modified by their methods.

```javascript
let counter = {
    count: 0,
    increment() {
        this.count++;
    },
    decrement() {
        this.count--;
    },
    getCount() {
        return this.count;
    }
};

counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // Output: 2
counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // Output: 1
```

### Description Script:
Think of an object maintaining state like a vending machine. The vending machine keeps track of how many items it has, how much money it's collected, etc. This is its "state".

In our example, the `counter` object is like a simple counting machine. It has an internal state (`count`) and methods to change that state (`increment` and `decrement`) or check it (`getCount`).

Each time we call `increment()`, it's like pressing the "+" button on our counting machine. The machine updates its internal count.

When we call `getCount()`, it's like looking at the display of our counting machine to see what number it's currently showing.

This ability to maintain and modify state is what makes objects so powerful. They can model real-world things that have changing properties over time.

### 3.1 Private State with Closures

We can use closures to create private state that can't be directly accessed from outside the object:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
        increment() {
            count++;
        },
        decrement() {
            count--;
        },
        getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

let counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter.count); // Output: undefined
```
