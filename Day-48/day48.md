## Reflections and Notes

Meeting went well, it evolved from 2 projects with about a months of work each, to assuming a sr devveloper role for both for at least a year with both salaries and equity. The work is all remote and time flexible so I can balance my own projects with the work. This is huge, my biggest goal of the dev challenge was to secure employment and this checks that off the list, this could make the other goal of hitting a 6 figure income by the end of the challenge.
