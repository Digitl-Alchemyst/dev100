## Reflections and Notes

I decided to see how much I could get done with AI being the lead dev and me just cleaning up its mistakes. I am pretty impressed with claudes capiblities model was using hiaku i think. It made one mistake by using pages router fetchign and caching methods it gave a solid layout, it had a few small errors implmenting sanity studio but it was nothing to get it working in dev mode, there are a few build errors so no deploy tonight. 

Moms surgery took up most of the day today and all day yesterday with appointments Will be back to normal tomorrow aside from taking care of her around the house. but should have plenty of work time tomorrow.
