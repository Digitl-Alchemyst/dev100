## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

Good day, class! Today, we're diving into the Observer design pattern in JavaScript. This pattern is crucial in many modern applications, especially those dealing with event-driven programming and real-time updates.

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is a key part of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is widely used in JavaScript for handling DOM events, implementing pub/sub systems, and managing state in front-end frameworks.

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how to implement the basic Observer pattern and explore more advanced concepts like dynamic subscription management and complex state change notifications.

## 2. Basic Observer Pattern (15 minutes)

Let's start with a basic implementation of the Observer pattern in JavaScript.

```javascript
class Subject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  addObserver(observer) {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  removeObserver(observer) {
    const index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);
    if (index > -1) {
      this.observers.splice(index, 1);
    }
  }

  notifyObservers(data) {
    for (let observer of this.observers) {
      observer.update(data);
    }
  }
}

class Observer {
  update(data) {
    console.log('Received update:', data);
  }
}

// Usage
const subject = new Subject();
const observer1 = new Observer();
const observer2 = new Observer();

subject.addObserver(observer1);
subject.addObserver(observer2);

subject.notifyObservers('Hello, observers!');
```

Let's break down this code:

1. The `Subject` class:
   - Maintains a list of observers
   - Provides methods to add and remove observers
   - Has a method to notify all observers

2. The `Observer` class:
   - Has an `update` method that gets called when the subject notifies it

3. Usage:
   - We create a subject and two observers
   - We add both observers to the subject
   - We notify all observers with a message

This basic implementation demonstrates the core concept of the Observer pattern. The subject doesn't need to know the specifics of its observers, it just notifies them when there's an update. This decoupling is a key benefit of the pattern.

In real-world scenarios, you might have different types of observers that respond to updates in different ways. For example, in a weather monitoring application, you might have a display observer that updates the UI, and a logger observer that writes to a log file.

## 3. Advanced Concepts (20 minutes)

Now that we've covered the basics, let's explore some more advanced concepts.

### 3.1 Dynamic Subscription Management

In many applications, observers need to subscribe and unsubscribe dynamically based on certain conditions. Let's enhance our previous example to include this functionality.

```javascript
class AdvancedSubject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = new Map();
  }

  subscribe(event, observer) {
    if (!this.observers.has(event)) {
      this.observers.set(event, new Set());
    }
    this.observers.get(event).add(observer);
  }

  unsubscribe(event, observer) {
    if (this.observers.has(event)) {
      this.observers.get(event).delete(observer);
    }
  }

  notify(event, data) {
    if (this.observers.has(event)) {
      for (let observer of this.observers.get(event)) {
        observer.update(event, data);
      }
    }
  }
}

class AdvancedObserver {
  update(event, data) {
    console.log(`Received update for ${event}:`, data);
  }
}

// Usage
const advancedSubject = new AdvancedSubject();
const observer1 = new AdvancedObserver();
const observer2 = new AdvancedObserver();

advancedSubject.subscribe('event1', observer1);
advancedSubject.subscribe('event2', observer2);

advancedSubject.notify('event1', 'Hello, event1 observers!');
advancedSubject.notify('event2', 'Hello, event2 observers!');

advancedSubject.unsubscribe('event1', observer1);
advancedSubject.notify('event1', 'This won\'t reach observer1');
```

In this advanced implementation:

1. We use a `Map` to store observers, where the key is the event type and the value is a `Set` of observers interested in that event.
2. The `subscribe` method allows observers to subscribe to specific events.
3. The `unsubscribe` method allows observers to unsubscribe from specific events.
4. The `notify` method only notifies observers interested in the specific event.

This approach allows for more granular control over which observers receive which notifications, making our system more efficient and flexible.

### 3.2 Complex State Changes and Conditional Notifications

In some cases, you might want to notify observers only when certain conditions are met, or when complex state changes occur. Let's implement this concept with a simple stock market example.

```javascript
class Stock {
  constructor(symbol, price) {
    this.symbol = symbol;
    this.price = price;
    this.observers = new Map();
  }

  subscribe(observer, threshold) {
    this.observers.set(observer, threshold);
  }

  unsubscribe(observer) {
    this.observers.delete(observer);
  }

  setPrice(newPrice) {
    const oldPrice = this.price;
    this.price = newPrice;

    for (let [observer, threshold] of this.observers) {
      const priceChange = Math.abs(newPrice - oldPrice) / oldPrice;
      if (priceChange >= threshold) {
        observer.update(this.symbol, oldPrice, newPrice, priceChange);
      }
    }
  }
}

class StockObserver {
  update(symbol, oldPrice, newPrice, percentChange) {
    console.log(`${symbol} price changed by ${(percentChange * 100).toFixed(2)}%`);
    console.log(`Old price: $${oldPrice}, New price: $${newPrice}`);
  }
}

// Usage
const appleStock = new Stock('AAPL', 150);
const observer1 = new StockObserver();
const observer2 = new StockObserver();

appleStock.subscribe(observer1, 0.01); // Notify on 1% change
appleStock.subscribe(observer2, 0.05); // Notify on 5% change

appleStock.setPrice(152); // 1.33% change, notifies observer1 only
appleStock.setPrice(160); // 5.26% change, notifies both observers
```

In this example:

1. The `Stock` class represents a subject (the stock) with a price that can change.
2. Observers can subscribe with a threshold, indicating the minimum percentage change they're interested in.
3. The `setPrice` method calculates the percentage change and only notifies observers whose threshold has been met or exceeded.

This implementation demonstrates how we can add complex logic to our notification system, making it more sophisticated and tailored to specific needs.

## 4. Conclusion and Q&A (5 minutes)

To wrap up, we've covered the fundamentals of the Observer pattern and explored some advanced concepts:

1. We started with a basic implementation, demonstrating the core Subject-Observer relationship.
2. We then enhanced our implementation to support dynamic event-based subscriptions, allowing for more granular control over notifications.
3. Finally, we looked at how to implement complex state changes and conditional notifications, using a stock market example.

The Observer pattern is a powerful tool in your JavaScript toolkit. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain consistency between related objects without tightly coupling them. This pattern is extensively used in event handling, user interface updates, and in implementing reactive programming paradigms.

Remember, while the Observer pattern offers many benefits, it's important to use it judiciously. Overuse can lead to complex systems that are hard to debug, especially when observers make changes that trigger updates to other observers.

In your projects, consider using this pattern when you have a one-to-many relationship between objects, where a change in one object should be reflected in multiple other objects, without the changed object needing to know the specifics of what needs to be updated.

Are there any questions about the Observer pattern or how it can be applied in your projects?
