    - Warm-up Exercise: Print a table containing multiplication tables Let’s start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school. Can you print a table that contains all the answers to the multiplication tables from 1 through 10? This should be a function that either takes in a number and returns a table for that number or takes in no parameters at all and just prints a complete table (all the tables from 1 through 10).
