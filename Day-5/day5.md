### 4. **I wrote some code today.**:

    - Warm-up Exercise: Print a table containing multiplication tables Let’s start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school. Can you print a table that contains all the answers to the multiplication tables from 1 through 10? This should be a function that either takes in a number and returns a table for that number or takes in no parameters at all and just prints a complete table (all the tables from 1 through 10).

    - Project: Working on Firebase rules for DocuBot

### 5. **Daily Reset**:

    - 1.5 mile jog/walk, play with rhythm after school.

### 6. **I had a productive afternoon.**:

    - Healthy Lunch: Peanutbutter Banana Sandwhich

    - Clean Living room, remove clutter toys that just get thrown around floor

### 7. **Support the Community**:
