### 4. 💻 Coding Progress

- 🧠 Warm-up Exercise: You're tasked with creating an asynchronous task queue system for a social media management tool. This system needs to handle posting to multiple social media platforms, each with its own API and potential for errors. Your job is to implement a robust task queue that can handle various types of errors, provide useful feedback, and manage concurrent executions.
- 🦺 Project: EBT Full Refactor
- 📝 Code Snippet:

```javascript
this.activeTasks++;
const { task, resolve, reject } = this.queue.shift();

try {
  const result = await task();
  resolve(result);
} catch (error) {
  reject(error);
} finally {
  this.activeTasks--;
  this.runNext();
}
```
