## Today, I accomplished the following:

    - 

### 3. 📚 **I learned something today.**:

    - 🦸‍♂️ **Zero to Full Stack Hero**: No courses this weekend 

    - Group learning sessions all day. lots of resources used far to many to link up this time. Im running out all daily credits on 4 gpt accounts & 4 claude accounts. 

### 4. 🖥️ **I wrote some code today.**:

    - 🏋️‍♂️ Warm-up Exercise: Your task is to complete the implementation of a **secret message encoder**. The encoder will use a series of **nested functions** to transform a given message. Each function in the chain will add a layer of encryption to the message. This challenge will involve closures to ensure that certain aspects of the encoding process remain hidden, making the encoder more secure.

    - 🦺 Project: Time was balanced between learning and project work

### 5. 🏃 **Daily Reset**:

    - Play time with kids

### 6. 🌈 **I had a productive afternoon.**:

    - 🍱 Healthy Lunch: Pantry low tomorrow is grocery day so light snacks
