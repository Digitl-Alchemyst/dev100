### 4. 💻 Coding Progress

- 🏋️‍♂️ Warm-up Exercise: Implement two fundamental array operations in JavaScript: sorting and binary search. Create a function that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order, and another function that performs a binary search on a sorted array. These operations are crucial in computer science and demonstrate important concepts in algorithm design and efficiency.

- 🦺 Project: Daily Coding Challenge Site: Main UI
- 📝 Code Snippet:
  ```javascript
   while (left <= right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
