### 4. **I wrote some code today.**:

    - Warm-up Exercise: Found a coding challenge that asked for a power calcultor using voltage and current to find power. The math was simple and the challenge was to easy so I expanded it to include 3 other conversions, still simple math. I learned more about electricity than I did coding tbh. But still fun.
