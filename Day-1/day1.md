# Dev 75 - Day 1

## Today, I accomplished the following:

1. **Productive morning**:

    - Son dressed and fed for school

    - Bed made

    - Desk cleaned

    - Got son to school on time despite bus skipping the house (AGAIN >.<)

    - Decent breakfast: Eggs, Toast, Hashbrowns, Turmeric Orange Juice

2. **Sort my To-Dos**:
    - [Checkmate AI](https://checkmate-ai.vercel.app/)

    - Using my first ever Sonny project, the Kanban Trello clone, to track my ToDos

    - As of posting, I have done 3/5 tasks (wife is at the doctor with one kid, and I got the other so the last coding task is on hold; cat box is an after-dinner before shower chore so looking solid)

    - Already stacking up TODOs for tomorrow as I hit 2 dead ends today

    - End of the day wrapped up final TODOs from my list

3. **30 mins of learning**:
    - **Zero to Full Stack Hero**: Introduction to Web Development, Web Development Roadmap & Extensions you NEED to install right now!, List of HTML Basics

    - **How to implement Clean Architecture in Node.js**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmY22KuRDbk)

    - **My Neovim Dev Workflow**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7-qUMKSH_Y)

    - **Performing under Pressure Podcast**: [Hank Weisinger Interview](https://ozanvarol.com/hank-weisinger/)

    - **Please Stop Using Barrel Files**: [Blog Post](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/please-stop-using-barrel-files)

    - **How to Build Anything Extremely Quickly**: [Blog Post](https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly)

    - The Performing Under Pressure podcast, I found this in a comments section on one of the articles I read this morning. I think it was the build anything quickly article. I also got the e-book he was talking about throughout the podcast for later. Really good topic for today I feel

4. **Time to Code**:

    - Quick Exercise: Random Number Generator. This came from the zero-to-hero intro lessons. Sonny said to make a quick little random number generator and explore some of the Math functions. So I did and it ended up generating random numbers from both Math and crypto, then doing some math on them, generating a random UUID and trimming the dashes, then splicing the two together at random using Math.random to sort the indices of both strings at random for a pretty unique random string.

    - Rate limiting for DocuBot: Rate limiting on file size set with toast notifications to inform the user of the reason for the file being declined.

5. **Daily Reset**:

    - Plan: Going  jogging route: 0.45 miles, half uphill, half down, shooting for a solid speed-up hill with a steady pace down and back around the home.

    - Productive Afternoon: Wife ran late, no jog today. Did some chores instead: kitchen cleaned, bed linens washed and bed remade, son fed and bathed(2x).

    - Indoor workout: Couldnt go for a run had to stay with the toddler, 4x 25 reps push-ups last 10 of the last set were brutal but I pushed through it, 30 30-minute break dance session with my son (hella cardio) & stretches.

6. **Support the Community**:

    - [Responsive Image Grid](https://www.skool.com/universityofcode/responsive-image-grid?p=0c7333e3)
