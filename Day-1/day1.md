# Dev 75 - Day 1

## Today, I accomplished the following:

1. **Productive morning**: 
    - Son dressed and fed for school
    - Bed made
    - Desk cleaned
    - Got son to school on time despite bus skipping the house (AGAIN >.<)
    - Decent breakfast: Eggs, Toast, Hashbrowns, Turmeric Orange Juice

2. **Sort my To-Dos**: 
    - [Checkmate AI](https://checkmate-ai.vercel.app/)
    - Using my first ever Sonny project, the Kanban Trello clone, to track my ToDos 
    - As of posting, I have done 3/5 tasks (wife is at doc with one kid, I got the other so the last coding task is on hold; cat box is an after dinner before shower chore so looking solid)
    - Already stacking up TODOs for tomorrow as I hit 2 dead ends today

3. **30 mins of learning**: 
    - **Zero to Full Stack Hero**: Introduction to Web Development, Web Development Roadmap & Extensions you NEED to install right now!, List of HTML Basics
    - **How to implement Clean Architecture in Node.js**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmY22KuRDbk)
    - **My Neovim Dev Workflow**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7-qUMKSH_Y)
    - **Performing under Pressure Podcast**: [Hank Weisinger Interview](https://ozanvarol.com/hank-weisinger/)
    - **Please Stop Using Barrel Files**: [Blog Post](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/please-stop-using-barrel-files)
    - **How to Build Anything Extremely Quickly**: [Blog Post](https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly)
    - Halfway through the Performing Under Pressure podcast, I found this in a comments section on one of the articles I read this morning. I think it was the build anything quickly article. I also got the e-book he was talking about throughout the podcast for later. Really good for today I feel 

4. **Time to Code**: 
    - Quick Exercise: Random Number Generator. This came from the zero-to-hero intro lessons. Sonny said to make a quick little random number generator and explore some of the Math functions. So I did and it ended up generating random numbers from both Math and crypto, then doing some math on them, generating a random UUID and trimming the dashes, then splicing the two together at random using Math.random to sort the indices of both strings at random for a pretty unique random string.
    - Rate limiting for DocuBot: Still to do when the wife gets home

5. **Daily Reset**: 
    - Going for a jog route: 0.45 miles, half uphill, half down, shooting for a solid speed-up hill with a steady pace down and back around home. 
    - Productive Afternoon: Wife ran late, no jog today. Did some chores instead: kitchen cleaned, bed linens washed and bed remade, son fed and bathed.
    - Indoor workout: 4x 25 reps push-ups, 30 min break dance session with son (hella cardio) & stretches.

6. **Support the Community**: 
    - [Responsive Image Grid](https://www.skool.com/universityofcode/responsive-image-grid?p=0c7333e3)
    - [Vercel 10 Second Function Timeout](https://www.skool.com/universityofcode/vercel-10-second-function-time-out-please-read?p=106dca26)
