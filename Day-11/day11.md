# Dev 100 - Day 11

## Today, I accomplished the following:

### 1. ☀️ **I had a productive morning.**:

    - 🍳 Healthy Breakkfast: Granola Bars

    - Cleaned up Room Made Coffee

### 3. 📚 **I learned something today.**:

    - [6 Nextjs Projects to Become a Better Developer](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/6-nextjs-projects-to-become-a-better-developer-61177e6d3741)

    - [Next.js 15 Introduces Breaking Cache Strategy Changes](https://weijunext.medium.com/next-js-15-introduces-breaking-cache-strategy-changes-a594e3b504df) - Everyone cried about next 14 caching strategies, It was one thing I liked about next 14. Vercel answered the community cries and changed it up and now it seems like people are crying about that too. I think a setting in the next config is what was needed that will allow the caching strategy to be set globally.

    - ["Clean Architecture" and indirection. No thanks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rgH0Kb9Bis) WAAAY over my head.
