## Reflections and Notes

Stressful days dealing with trying to get basic essentials out of my car dealer, doctors refue to treat my son. its a fight every time I deal with with them and makes for a massively stressfull day. Starting to put these task all to one day and not let it ruin multiple days on end trying to spot deal with it.
