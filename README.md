### Daily Tasks:

Here are the 8 daily task to complete for the next 100 (Dont skip weekends.) continuous days to complete the challenge 👇

1️⃣ **Start Your Day Right**: 

Note your productive morning. This could include making your bed, going to the gym, or getting ready for the day/work. Be sure to have a healthy breakfast and get your day started right.🌞 Answer any emails in your inbox and clear it of junk for the day. ( Make sure to keep up with your inbox through out the day )

2️⃣ **Organize Your Tasks**: 

Write down your main tasks for the day. Having a clear to-do list will keep you focused and productive throughout the day. Delagate dead-end task to a later day in the week. (The business you need to interact with is closed for the day, or you're waiting on a response from a client)

3️⃣ **Hit the Books**: 

Part 1: Complete at least one module in your education course. I am using the [Zero to Full Stack Hero](https://www.papareact.com/course) course. But this can be any course you're taking, such as a college course or coding bootcamp. If you're not taking a course, you can choose from a variety of online resources like YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, or even books.

Part 2: Dedicate 30 minutes to learning something new outside of the course you are taking. This can be a YouTube video, article / blog post, book, podcast, or newsletter.

4️⃣ **Time to Code**: 

Part 1: Complete at least one simple coding exercise this can come from resource including an exercise that come up with your self, or a coding challenge you find online.

Part 2: Write some code in a real project. This can be a pet project you've been working, a website you're building, or a portfolio project you're working on.

5️⃣ **Daily Reset**: 

Take a break and do some sort of relaxation exercise like meditation, exercise, go for a walk or a jog or even take a quick nap; do something to rejuvenate yourself and to keep your body and mind fresh. Have a healthy lunch and drink some water.

6️⃣ **Productive Afternoon**: 

Keep the day rolling with a productive afternoon. This could include working on a project, catching up on house chores or spending time with family or friends. You should make sure you have cleared your to-do list and start to form a clear plan for the next day. Check your physical mail and read and act on any any important mail.

7️⃣ **Support the Community**: 

This could be in your real life, in any community, in the University of Code, or in the [JS Help Desk Discord](https://discord.gg/aDumcW6ESB). Helping others is a great way to reinforce your knowledge and boost your confidence! It also helps you build a network of like-minded individuals.

8️⃣ **Track your Progress**: 

Part 1: Clone this repo and add a new folder & markdown file for each day. In each days folder (you can use the markdown file for the day) add your TODO list and check off each item as they are completed. Add your daily coding exercise to this folder. Once your daily routine is complete, commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.

Part 2: You can post your progress in our discord server [JS Help Desk](https://discord.gg/aDumcW6ESB) in the dev100 channel.This challenge is based off of the dev75 challenge from university of code. You can track your progress on the [Dev75 Category](https://www.skool.com/universityofcode?c=37292acda99f4c61b906b8840a85d00c&s=newest-cm&fl=) in University of Code.
