# Welcome to the Dev75 Coding Challenge at the University of Code! üôå

Sticking to a routine and staying motivated can be tough for developers. That's why we've extended our popular Dev30 Coding Challenge into the Dev75 Coding Challenge ‚Äì a 75-day journey to help you further improve your coding skills and stay on track with your goals! üöÄ

We understand how busy everyone can be, so we've kept the structure simple with 7 daily tasks designed to help you learn, stay organized, and remain active in the University of Code community. By completing these daily tasks, you'll boost productivity, learn new things, and enhance your coding skills to become the best developers you can be! üí™

Here are the 7 daily steps to complete for the next 75 continuous days to complete the challenge üëá
