### 3. 📚 Learning

- 🔗 [Turn ANY AI Agent into a Live Person - Voice Chat Setup in Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9JqdwdCiyE)
- 🔗 [🔴 Let’s build an AI Help Bot with NEXT.JS 14! (Neon PostgreSQL, Clerk, AI Agent, OpenAI, IBM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RloLpftGwyc&t=3s&ab_channel=SonnySangha) Just started on this about 30 min. Going to do this project and add it to my AI Alchemy site
- 🔗 [🔴 Let's build a Full Stack E-Commerce App with NEXT.JS 15 (Sanity, Stripe, Clerk, Tailwind, TS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-fgWea75O4) Watched a bit more of this. Will probably skip ahead to the live updates stuff tomorrow.
- 🔗 [Step by Step: Scrape UNLIMITED Emails for FREE with n8n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzMNuuS5JbI&t=1439s) Built this today. Super fire lead scraper I got over 1,000 email address for local businesses in a single industry today took about 40 min to run 92 queries scraping a ton of websites for all email addresses. 10/10 recommend. If anyone builds this hit me up I will show you how to add in filters on teh email part to filter out emails like @example.com 

### 4. 💻 Coding Progress

- 🧠 Warm-up Exercise: 
    - Create a state management system using JavaScript's Proxy object to automatically track and react to state changes. The system should intercept state modifications and provide automatic change detection without explicitly calling setter methods, similar to Vue.js's reactivity system.
    - Create an Observable State pattern implementation that allows objects to subscribe to state changes and receive automatic updates when the state is modified. This pattern is crucial for implementing reactive programming concepts and is similar to patterns used in RxJS and Vue's reactivity system.
    - Create a reducer function that manages state transitions through pure functions, similar to Redux's reducer pattern. The reducer should handle different action types to update state in an immutable way, demonstrating how to manage complex state transformations through pure functions.
- 🦺 Project: EBT - Continuing to refine the blog posting workflow. AI-Alchemy Stripe intergertion and onboarding for initial consults
- 📝 Code Snippet:

```javascript
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + action.payload };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - action.payload };
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return { ...state, todos: [...state.todos, action.payload] };
    case 'SET_USER':
      return { ...state, user: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
```
