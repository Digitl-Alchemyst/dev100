## Reflections and Notes

Light day still got a lot done. Birthday stuff took up most of the day but had a lot of fun. Only one family from my sons school came but the mom was super cool and we had a great time. His teacher also came and brought a little one from her family, really makes me feel good about his school and that they truly are putting in so much effort with him. Realzied I missed posting a few days along the way so i need to go see if i did them or skipped them some how and post up.
