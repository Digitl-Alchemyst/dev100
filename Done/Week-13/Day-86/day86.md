### 4. 💻 Coding Progress

- 🧠 Warm-up Exercise: Create a custom EventEmitter class that implements the core functionality of Node.js's EventEmitter. The EventEmitter should allow for subscribing to events using the 'on' method and triggering events using the 'emit' method. This implementation will demonstrate the publisher-subscriber pattern, a fundamental concept in event-driven programming.
Create a simple state container that manages application state with get/set methods and notifies subscribers of state changes. This implementation will demonstrate fundamental concepts of state management similar to simplified versions of Redux or Vue's reactive system.
- 🦺 Project: AI Assisstant, Finalized Email sorter, receipt processing, & job recruiter intake & triggers
- 📝 Code Snippet:

```javascript
emit = (eventName, ...args) => {
    // TODO: Trigger all callbacks associated with the event
    if (!this.events.has(eventName)) return false;
    this.events.get(eventName).forEach(callback => callback(...args));
    return true;
  };
```
