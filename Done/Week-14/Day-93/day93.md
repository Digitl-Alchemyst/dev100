## Reflections and Notes

Stressfull day, productive day. Had to leave the live before it was over because running the video + 4 shopping tabs was to much for my back up PC (Its an OLD Dell Optiplex). I have been doing everything I have up to this point on a GTX 960 / AMD FX9590.It served me well for around 10 years. Moving on to a fresh build with a 4070 Ti Super and AMD Ryzen 7 8700g with a 16 TOPS NPU(AI Chip) This should be fun running local LLMs and other models with ease. Excited. I will be coding from this piece of junk dell for a few days. Its going to be frustrating to say the least.
