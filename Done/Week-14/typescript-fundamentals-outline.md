# Week 14: TypeScript Fundamentals

## Overview
This week introduces JavaScript developers to TypeScript fundamentals, focusing on static typing and object-oriented programming concepts. Each day builds upon previous knowledge to create a comprehensive understanding of TypeScript's core features progressing from basic type systems to advanced TypeScript features.

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Basic Types and Type Annotations
- Introduction to TypeScript's type system
- Working with primitive types (number, string, boolean)
- Type annotations and type inference
- Understanding the `any` and `unknown` types
- Challenge focus: Converting JavaScript functions to use TypeScript types

### Day 2: Interfaces and Type Aliases
- Creating and implementing interfaces
- Type aliases vs interfaces
- Optional and readonly properties
- Extending interfaces
- Challenge focus: Building a structured data model using interfaces

### Day 3: Functions in TypeScript
- Function type annotations
- Optional and default parameters
- Rest parameters
- Function overloads
- Challenge focus: Implementing function signatures and overloads

### Day 4: Classes and Access Modifiers
- Class implementation in TypeScript
- Public, private, and protected modifiers
- Abstract classes
- Implementing interfaces in classes
- Challenge focus: Converting a JavaScript class hierarchy to TypeScript

### Day 5: Generics
- Introduction to generic types
- Generic functions and classes
- Generic constraints
- Generic interfaces
- Challenge focus: Building reusable generic components

 

### Day 7: Advanced Types and Utility Types
- Mapped types
- Conditional types
- Built-in utility types (Partial, Pick, Record)
- Type assertions
- Challenge focus: Using advanced type features to solve complex problems

## Learning Objectives

## Prerequisites
- Solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- Experience with ES6+ features
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js installed
- TypeScript compiler (tsc) installed
- Code editor with TypeScript support (VS Code recommended)
