## Reflections and Notes

PC Build part one. went pretty smooth but cant decide if I want to use this case, recycle the old one, or buy a new one like the old one. Plan to sleep on it. Need thermal paste anyway. the m.2 drives I got dont fit because my motherboard has heatsyncs already sigh. Oh well I can work with this for the time being.
