### 4. 💻 Coding Progress

- 🧠 Warm-up Exercise: his challenge focuses on using `Object.entries()` to manipulate weather data in various ways, including temperature conversion and data formatting. This challenge introduces practical applications of `Object.entries()` in JavaScript, demonstrating how to work with key-value pairs simultaneously. It's particularly relevant for data processing tasks where you need to access both the keys (days) and values (temperatures) of an object while transforming the data.

- 🦺 Project: EBT Make automation work, also creating same flow in n8n

- 📝 Code Snippet:

```javascript
  const celsiusData = Object.entries(data).map(([day, temp]) => [
    day,
    (temp - 32) * (5 / 9),
  ]);
```
