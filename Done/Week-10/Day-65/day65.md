## Reflections and Notes

Today was really a next conf day. so it was a little different. Shared a lot of knowledge with the community on discord. The whole experience they set up for the digital conf was very emersive felt like I was at a real conference. Lots of connections made and a lot of knowledge learned. Excited for the future of Next.js and sanity.io both. 'use chace' is a game changer, I did not like the idea at first, I was one of the few that liked the default opted into caching of next 14. How ever the presentations made me a believer in the caching changes and the new methods. Sanity has really pushed the limits of caching in Next.js pretty far, showing off no reload content changes to live production sites in real time at near instant speed pretty freaking mind blowing.
