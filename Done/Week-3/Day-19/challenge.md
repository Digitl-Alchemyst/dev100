Day 5 Coding Challenge: Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Problem Statement
Create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## Function Signature
function generateFibonacci(n) {
   // Your code here 
}

## Input
- `n`: A positive integer representing the number of terms to generate.

## Output
The function should return an array containing the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Examples
Input: 7  
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Input: 3  
Output: [0, 1, 1]

## Test the Function
console.log(generateFibonacci(7)); // Should print [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]  
console.log(generateFibonacci(3)); // Should print [0, 1, 1]

## Expanded Instructions

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1. For example, the sequence begins as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on. The challenge is to create a function that can generate this sequence up to a specified number of terms `n`. The function should be able to handle different values of `n`, including small values like 1 or larger values that require calculating many terms.

### Step 2: Potential Solutions

**Iterative Approach:**  
This method uses a loop to build the Fibonacci sequence. Starting with the first two terms (0 and 1), the function will add these two numbers to generate the next term, continuing this process until the desired number of terms is reached.

**Recursive Approach:**  
A recursive solution could define the Fibonacci sequence in terms of itself, with the nth term being the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th terms. While this approach is conceptually elegant, it is less efficient for generating the entire sequence because it involves redundant calculations.

### Step 3: Implementing the Function (Iterative Approach)
function generateFibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 0) return [];
  if (n === 1) return [0];
  
  let sequence = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    sequence.push(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]);
  }
  return sequence;
}

**Explanation:**  
- **Edge Cases:** The function begins by handling special cases. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty array because there are no terms to generate. If `n` is 1, it returns an array with just the first Fibonacci number `[0]`.
- **Loop:** For values of `n` greater than 1, the function initializes the sequence with the first two terms `[0, 1]`. It then uses a for loop to continue generating the sequence by adding the last two numbers in the sequence and appending the result to the array. This loop continues until the sequence contains `n` terms.

## Bonus Challenge

### Extended Functionality: Generate Fibonacci Numbers Recursively

**Problem:**  
Implement the Fibonacci sequence generator using a recursive approach instead of an iterative one.

**Function Signature:**
function recursiveFibonacci(n) {
   // Your code here 
}

**Example:**
Input: 7  
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

**Hint:**  
In this approach, the Fibonacci sequence is generated by defining the nth term as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, with the base cases being `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`. You'll need to call the function recursively for each term and store the results to avoid redundant calculations (this can be optimized using memoization).
