## Reflections and Notes

Full day building PC FIlled up memory card on camera twice. Lots of back tracking and chanigng my mind on configuration.
It booted the first time ( always happens with my builds ) . I did have an old drive inside that already had windows so I had to do just a little bit to get that working correctly. Half of my fans did not light up but a firmware update for the controller fixxed that so all in all a near perfect build. While the cable management was hands down the cleanest job Ive done yet. I got a little sloppy with cables coming out of the PSU but I am going to change it when I add the final drive configuration so I initentionally put little effort into it knowing it would change. I put Assassins Creed Mirage on the machine to test out proformance. Runnig on high graphics 0 lag all internal temps stay below thershold. Video card does not arrive until friday so this was a solid test of the in chip gpu from amd, mu st say I am impressed.
