# Day 1 Coding Challenge: Function Basics

## Problem Statement

Create three functions that demonstrate different ways of declaring functions in JavaScript: a function declaration, a function expression, and an arrow function. Each function should take two numbers as parameters and return their sum.

## Function Signatures

1. Function Declaration:
   `function sumDeclaration(a, b)`

2. Function Expression:
   `const sumExpression = function(a, b)`

3. Arrow Function:
   `const sumArrow = (a, b) =>`

## Input
- Two numbers, `a` and `b`

## Output
Each function should return the sum of `a` and `b`.

## Examples
1. Input: `a = 5, b = 3`
   Output: `8` (for all three functions)

2. Input: `a = -1, b = 7`
   Output: `6` (for all three functions)

## Test the Functions

Test each function with the following inputs:
1. `5` and `3`
2. `-1` and `7`

## Expanded Instructions

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The goal is to create three different types of functions that all perform the same task: adding two numbers. This will demonstrate the syntax and usage of function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions.

### Step 2: Implementing the Functions

Implement each function type as described in the function signatures. Each should take two parameters and return their sum.

### Step 3: Testing the Functions

After implementing the functions, test each one with the provided test cases to ensure they all work correctly.

### Explanation:
This challenge introduces the three main ways of defining functions in JavaScript. The function declaration is the traditional way, the function expression assigns an anonymous function to a variable, and the arrow function provides a more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
