- 🔗 [JavaScript for Beginners: Multidimensional Arrays + "For In" Loop (Lesson 18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnOAPEJGSw4)
- 🔗 [Learn 2D ARRAYS in JavaScript in 6 minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJNeJuLmVo)

### 4. 💻 Coding Progress

- 🧠 Warm-up Exercise: Implement two functions to work with 2D arrays (matrices) in JavaScript: one that transposes a matrix (swaps rows and columns), and another that calculates the sum of each row in a matrix. This challenge aims to improve your understanding of multi-dimensional array manipulation, which is crucial for various applications in data processing, image manipulation, and mathematical computations.

            let sum = 0;
            for (let k = 0; k < matrix1[0].length; k++) {
                sum += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j];
            }
