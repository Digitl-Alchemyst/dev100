### 4. 🖥️ **I wrote some code today.**:

    - 🏋️‍♂️ Warm-up Exercise: Create a function called `createCounter` that returns another function, known as the counter function. The counter function, when called, should increment and return the current count. The initial value of the count should be specified when creating the counter. This is a great way to explore closures in JavaScript, as the inner function (the counter) will have access to the outer function's scope even after the outer function has finished executing.


    - 🦺 Project: More corporate structure.
